# Kernel references

Choose the current workflow from [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md), then consult the matching topic. This is the single overall index; it does not require reading every reference in advance.

## Directory responsibilities

| `api/` | How does this interface or mechanism work? | DSL constraints, resource/synchronization contracts and API-family behavior boundaries |
| `diagnostics/` | Why did it fail, and what can checks detect? | Error interpretation, blind spots, validation traps, regression leads and specific defects |
| `verification/` | How can results be trusted? | Device runs, native-task timing, evidence assessment and working methods |

This skill bundles its knowledge, tools and examples. Framework source and the installed runtime remain external; no simulator is included.

## Admission rules

- Agent-facing prose, headings and explanatory script comments/docstrings in this skill use English. Preserve literal diagnostics, source quotations, API/path names and machine-consumed markers (including `写法：`, `反例：`, `[需核查]` and the fixed coverage heading) when translation would alter their meaning or interface. Replace prose in place rather than keeping parallel language versions.
- Keep only this index at the `references/` root. Classify new documents by the responsibilities above; use lowercase hyphenated filenames, not iteration- or provenance-based directories, and do not add duplicate indexes to every subdirectory.
- Workflows describe the next action and reading conditions. Computation patterns, API facts, diagnostics and verification methods have their own owners. Maintain each fact once and link to it elsewhere.
- Organize API references by family or mechanism. Preserve the distinct evidence and version boundaries of official contracts, installed source and measured behavior; sharing a directory does not make them interchangeable evidence.
- Summarize knowledge that transfers across examples. Keep individual details in native `kernel.py` / `test.py` files. Link to executable code, official framework material, machine configuration at their owners instead of copying them.
- Do not maintain historical pass counts, experiment ledgers or superseded reasoning narratives. Retain current conclusions, necessary counterexamples and applicability conditions; a historical pass is not current acceptance.
- Prefer source symbols over line numbers. Bind necessary line references to a version. Link checks do not establish agent effectiveness or hardware performance.
- When changing knowledge metadata, sources, paths or headings, update incoming links, relative paths, anchors and tool consumers together. Run the shared [knowledge admission gate](tooling/checks.md#knowledge-admission-and-refresh) with `check.py query --validate --format json`; check representative discovery, resolution and repaired/invalid inputs through the affected interfaces. Use explicit `check.py links` inputs for repository documents outside the selected references and run `check.py srcrefs` when source references are affected. `srcrefs` is heuristic: assess items individually rather than renumbering in bulk.

Shared facts have specific owners: authoring owns anchor adaptation, incremental construction, the reference/evaluator contract and boundary matrix; board-runs owns execution, probe validity and fault isolation; numerics owns arithmetic/representation criteria; examples owns test/example admission; native-timing owns executable identity, measurement protocols and counter interfaces; optimization owns diagnostic timing, experiment progression and stopping conditions; performance owns model/board interpretation. Patterns retain mechanisms and implementation comparisons without copying those procedures. Constraint entries identify a diagnostic and route to the API owner rather than maintaining a second copy of its mechanism or version limits. Keep cross-paradigm ownership and partitioning decisions in patterns.

Keep task entry and essential constraints in SKILL.md; maintain editorial guidance here. Getting-started is an intentional cache of foundational facts: keep its version digest consistent with its owners and recheck it when the framework baseline changes. Section references and historical measurements retain their individual version scopes; an old common date cannot validate the whole library. New routes remain discoverable from this skill’s entry or reference index.
